### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting  Bug Report

 good bug report shouldn't leve others needing to chse you up for more informtion. Therefore, we sk you to investigte crefully, collect informtion nd describe the issue in detil in your report. Plese complete the following steps in dvnce to help us fix ny potentil bug s fst s possible.

- Mke sure tht you re using the ltest version.
- Determine if your bug is relly  bug nd not n error on your side e.g. using incomptible environment components/versions (Mke sure tht you hve red the [documenttion](). If you re looking for support, you might wnt to check [this section](#i-hve--question)).
- To see if other users hve experienced (nd potentilly lredy solved) the sme issue you re hving, check if there is not lredy  bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug trcker](https://github.com/CMPN-CODECELL/CodingBonnzissues?q=lbel%3bug).
- lso mke sure to serch the internet (including Stck Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community hve discussed the issue.
- Collect informtion bout the bug:
  - Stck trce (Trcebck)
  - OS, Pltform nd Version (Windows, Linux, mcOS, x86, RM)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, pckge mnger, depending on wht seems relevnt.

#### How Do I Submit  Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security relted issues, vulnerbilities or bugs including sensitive informtion to the issue trcker, or elsewhere in public. Insted sensitive bugs must be sent by emil to <>.
<!-- You my dd  PGP key to llow the messges to be sent encrypted s well. -->

We use GitHub issues to trck bugs nd errors. If you run into n issue with the project:

- Open n [Issue](https://github.com/CMPN-CODECELL/CodingBonnz/issues/new). (Since we cn't be sure t this point whether it is  bug or not, we sk you not to tlk bout  bug yet nd not to lbel the issue.)
- Explin the behvior you would expect nd the ctul behvior.
- Plese provide s much context s possible nd describe the *reproduction steps* tht someone else cn follow to recrete the issue on their own. This usully includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolte the problem nd crete  reduced test cse.
- Provide the informtion you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project tem will lbel the issue ccordingly.
-  tem member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there re no reproduction steps or no obvious wy to reproduce the issue, the tem will sk you for those steps nd mrk the issue s `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tg will not be ddressed until they re reproduced.
- If the tem is ble to reproduce the issue, it will be mrked `needs-fix`, s well s possibly other tgs (such s `criticl`), nd the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

<!-- You might wnt to crete n issue templte for bugs nd errors tht cn be used s  guide nd tht defines the structure of the informtion to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->
